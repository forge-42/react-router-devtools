## Go To Source

**Shift + Right Click**

When you are in the browser and you want to go to the source code of a component, you can right click on the component
while holding down shift. This will open the source code of the component in your code editor.

## Opening/closing the DevTools

**Shift + A**

When you are in the browser and you want to open the Remix DevTools, you can press `Shift + A`. 
This will open the DevTools, if you're already in the DevTools, it will close it.

While in the DevTools, you can also use `Esc` to close them.

From version 4.2.0 is fully configurable and you can change the shortcut in the settings.

We use [react-hotkeys-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys-hook) to handle the keyboard shortcuts under the hood.
You can adapt to their API to add your own shortcuts.
