description: "How you can detach your panel into a new window"
---

There is a special button on the bottom left side of the panel above the X button. 
When you click on it, the panel will detach and open in a new window.

The detached window will keep in sync with the main panel and will show the same content.
The logs on the server will happen twice, once for the main panel and once for the detached window.

When you close the detached window, or the main panel, the other one will be terminated and closed.
In case the detached mode hangs for some reason, you can always return it to the main site by 
clicking the trigger while in detached mode.
