## Installation
Adding Remix Development Tools to your project is easy. First install it into your project by running:

```bash
npm install remix-development-tools -D
```

This will install it as a dev dependency in your project.

## Enabling the tools

After you have installed the tools, you need to go to your `vite.config.ts` file which will probably look something like this:

```ts 
import { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [remix(), tsconfigPaths()],
}) 

```

All you have to do is add the plugin into the `plugins` array in your `vite.config.ts` file. 

```diff 
import { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
+import { remixDevTools } from "remix-development-tools";

export default defineConfig({
-  plugins: [remix(), tsconfigPaths()], 
+  plugins: [remixDevTools(), remix(), tsconfigPaths()],
}) 

```
<Warn title="Warning">
Make sure your plugin is BEFORE the remix one!
</Warn>

**That's it!** 

You should now see the Remix Development Tools in your browser when you run your app.
