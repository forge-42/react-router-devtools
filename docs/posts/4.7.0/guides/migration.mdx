## v3.x => v4.x

### Vite plugin

If you're migrating your `remix-development-tools` from v3.x to v4.x and you were already running it as
a Vite plugin here is all you need to do:

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev';
- import { remixDevTools } from 'remix-development-tools/vite'
+ import { remixDevTools } from 'remix-development-tools'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [remixDevTools(), remix()],
})
```

### Remix compiler

<Info>
This section is only valid if you were not using the Vite plugin for Remix.
</Info>

If you were using the Remix compiler and not the Vite plugin, you will first need to do the following:
- Migrate your app to use the Vite plugin.
- Migrate your app from CJS to ESM (if applicable).

First thing you need to do after the above is change your package.json scripts to use the `remix vite:dev` command.
```diff
- "dev": "remix dev -c \"rdt-serve ./build/index.js\" --manual",
+ "dev": "remix vite:dev",
```

After you've done these things you need to remove everything from your `root.tsx` file that is
related to `remix-development-tools`.

```diff
// Import styles
- import rdtStylesheet from "remix-development-tools/index.css"; 
export const links: LinksFunction = () => [ 
-   ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: rdtStylesheet }] : []),
] 
 
- let AppExport = App;
// This imports the dev tools only if you're in development
- if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') { 
-   const { withDevTools } = await import("remix-development-tools"); 
-   AppExport = withDevTools(AppExport);
- }

- export default AppExport;
```

After this is done you might also need to remove the `remix-development-tools` package from your
custom server. An example of that would be something like this:
```diff
  // Somewhere in your server.ts file
  const build = await import(BUILD_PATH)
  let devBuild = build
  let devToolsConfig  = null; 
-  if(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
-    const { withServerDevTools, defineServerConfig } = await import("remix-development-tools/server"); 
-     // Allows you to define the configuration for the dev tools
-      devToolsConfig = defineServerConfig({ 
-      //... your config here ...
-    })
-    // wrap the build with the dev tools
-    devBuild = withServerDevTools(build, devToolsConfig)
-  }
 
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"){
  // .... somewhere later in your code ...
  // This makes sure the build is wrapped on reload, you will need this if you're running with the --manual flag
  async function reloadBuild() {
    devBuild = await import(`${BUILD_PATH}?update=${Date.now()}`)
    // wrap the build with dev tools on re-import
-    devBuild = withServerDevTools(devBuild, devToolsConfig)
    broadcastDevReady(devBuild)
  }
}
```

After all of this is done. You just need to add the `remix-development-tools` to your `vite.config.ts` file.

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev';
+ import { remixDevTools } from 'remix-development-tools'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
+   remixDevTools(),
    remix()
  ]
})
```

And that's it! You should be good to go. If you have any issues, please reach out to us.
