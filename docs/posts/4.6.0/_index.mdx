This documentation covers everything you need to know to get started with `remix-development-tools`.

## Prerequisites

- Remix version **2.8** or higher.
- Your project needs to run on **ESM**. If you are using CommonJS, you will need to convert your project to ESM.
- Remix has to run on **Vite**.

## Why ESM and Vite?

If you don't already know, Remix has become a Vite plugin. This means that Remix is now using Vite for bundling
and development instead of their own custom solution. Due to this `remix-development-tools` is also built on top of 
Vite and uses it extensively.

In order to use the full feature-set of **Vite** the project has to run on ESM. This is because Vite exposes a websocket
that **remix-development-tools** uses to communicate with the server. This websocket is **only** available in ESM projects 
because it's exposed by `import.meta` which is only available in ESM.

To avoid creating user confusion and giving you a subpar experience, we have decided to only support ESM projects running on Vite.

<Info>
 If you are using CommonJS non-Vite Remix app, you will need to convert your project to ESM. This is not as hard as it sounds.
  You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite#migrating) and [here](https://alemtuzlak.hashnode.dev/migrating-a-v1-cjs-remix-project-to-remix-vite-esm)

## Why use `remix-development-tools`?

`remix-development-tools` is a set of tools that help you to develop your Remix application. 

They help you, but are not limited to, to do the following things:
- **Loader data display** - You can see the data that is being loaded by your loaders.
- **Route display** - You can see the routes that are being used by your application in list/tree format.
- **Error tracking** - You can see invalid HTML rendered on your page and where it's coming from.
- **Hydration mismatch tracking** - You can see if there are any hydration mismatches in your application, what was rendered on the client and what was rendered on the server.
- **Server logs** - You can see the logs of your server in the browser.
- **Route boundaries** - You can see the route boundaries by hovering over elements.
