## Require URL Flag

This option is used to set whether the panel should be opened only if the URL contains a specific flag. The default value is `false`.

<Warn title="Be careful!">
If you set this option to `true` and you forget to set the URL flag, the panel will hide and you will not be able to see it
until you enter the url flag.

The default one is `rdt=true` and if you set this option to `true` you will have to add `?rdt=true` to the URL in order to see the panel.
</Warn>

## URL Flag

This option is used to set the URL flag that is required to open the panel. The default value is `rdt`.

You can set it to whatever you wish and if you set the **Require URL Flag** option to `true` you will have to add `?yourFlag=true` to the URL in order to see the panel.
