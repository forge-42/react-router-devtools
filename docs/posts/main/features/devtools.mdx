## Devtools extended context

The devtools context is a set of utilities that you can use in your data fetching functions to trace events
in the network tab of react-router-devtools. You can also include them in your production builds if you do not want
the hassle of having to optionally check if they are defined.

The general usage of the devtools context is as follows:

```ts
// The devTools object is available in all data fetching functions
export const loader = async ({ request, devTools }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // tracing is a set of utilities to be used in your data fetching functions to trace events
  // in network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing.start("my-event")
  // do something here, eg DB call
  tracing.end("my-event", startTime!)
  return "data"
}
```

You can also use the devtools context in your action functions:

```ts
export const action = async ({ request, devTools }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // tracing is a set of utilities to be used in your data fetching functions to trace events
  // in network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing?.start("my-event")
  // do something
  tracing?.end("my-event", startTime!)
  return "data"
}
```

The devtools context is also available in your client loader and client action functions:

```ts
export const clientLoader = async ({ request, devTools }: ClientLoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // tracing is a set of utilities to be used in your data fetching functions to trace events
  // in network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing?.start("my-event")
  // do something
  tracing?.end("my-event", startTime!)
  return "data"
}
```

```ts
export const clientAction = async ({ request, devTools }: ClientActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // tracing is a set of utilities to be used in your data fetching functions to trace events
  // in network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing?.start("my-event")
  // do something
  tracing?.end("my-event", startTime!)
  return "data"
}
```


<Info>
 If you want to make the devTools available always in your project, you can set `includeInProd` to `{ devTools: true }` in your vite config.

 In production the trace calls won't do anything, but the tracing will be more convinient to use.

 If you do so you can also override the types by adding the following to your project:
 ```ts
 import type { ExtendedContext } from "react-router-devtools/context";

	declare module "react-router" {
		interface LoaderFunctionArgs {
			devTools: ExtendedContext
		}
		interface ActionFunctionArgs {
			devTools: ExtendedContext
		}
	}
 ```

## RouteId

The routeId is a string that is used to identify the route that is being processed. You can access it like so:
```ts
const loader = async ({ request, devTools }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const routeId = devTools?.routeId;
  // do something with the routeId
  return "data"
}
```

## Tracing

The tracing object contains all the utilities related to network tab tracing feature of react-router-devtools.


There are three functions you can use:
- trace
- start
- end



### trace

The `trace` function is a function that will trace the event given to it, pipe it to the network tab of react-router-devtools and show you analytics.

This works by calling the provided function and analyzing the time it takes to execute it.

```ts
const loader = async ({ request, devTools }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // this will be traced in the network tab of react-router-devtools
  const user = tracing?.trace("my-event",() => getUser())

	return { user }
}
```

#### Parameters

- `name` - The name of the event
- `event` - The event to be traced

#### Returns

The result of the event

### start

The `start` function is a function that will start a trace for the name provided to it and return the start time.
This is used together with `end` to trace the time of the event.

```ts
export const loader = async ({ request, devTools }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // this will be traced in the network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing?.start("my-event")
  // do something here, eg DB call

	// End the trace
  tracing?.end("my-event", startTime!)
  return "data"
}
```

<Warn title="Warning">
 This function relies on you using the `end` with the same name as the start event, otherwise
you will end up having a never ending loading bar in the network tab!
</Warn>


#### Parameters

- `name` - The name of the event

#### Returns

The start time of the event

### end

The `end` function is a function that will end a trace for the name provided to it and return the end time.

```ts
export const loader = async ({ request, devTools }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const tracing = devTools?.tracing;
  // this will be traced in the network tab of react-router-devtools
  const startTime = tracing?.start("get user")
  // do something here, eg DB call
	const user = await getUser();
	// End the trace
  tracing?.end("get user", startTime!, { user })
  return "data"

}
```

#### Parameters

- `name` - The name of the event
- `startTime` - The start time of the sendEvent
- `data` - The data to be sent with the event

#### Returns

The data provided in the last parameter
