This documentation covers everything you need to know to get started with `react-router-devtools`.

## Prerequisites

- React Router version **7.0** or higher.
- Your project needs to run on **ESM**. If you are using CommonJS, you will need to convert your project to ESM.

## Why ESM?

In order to use the full feature-set of **Vite** the project has to run on ESM. This is because Vite exposes a websocket
that **react-router-devtools** uses to communicate with the server. This websocket is **only** available in ESM projects
because it's exposed by `import.meta` which is only available in ESM.

To avoid creating user confusion and giving you a subpar experience, we have decided to only support ESM projects running on Vite.

<Info>
 If you are using CommonJS non-Vite Remix app, you will need to convert your project to ESM and React Router.
 You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite#migrating) and
 [here](https://alemtuzlak.hashnode.dev/migrating-a-v1-cjs-remix-project-to-remix-vite-esm) to get you started with the migration

## Why use `react-router-devtools`?

`react-router-devtools` is a set of tools that help you to develop your Remix application.

They help you, but are not limited to, to do the following things:
- **Loader data display** - You can see the data that is being loaded by your loaders.
- **Route display** - You can see the routes that are being used by your application in list/tree format.
- **Error tracking** - You can see invalid HTML rendered on your page and where it's coming from.
- **Hydration mismatch tracking** - You can see if there are any hydration mismatches in your application, what was rendered on the client and what was rendered on the server.
- **Server logs** - You can see the logs of your server in the browser.
- **Route boundaries** - You can see the route boundaries by hovering over elements.
