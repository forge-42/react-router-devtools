### vite.config.ts

If you're migrating your `remix-development-tools` from v4.x to react-router v7 and you were already running it as
a Vite plugin here is all you need to do:

```diff
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
- import { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev';
+ import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite';
- import { remixDevTools } from 'remix-development-tools'
+ import { reactRouterDevTools } from 'react-router-devtools'

export default defineConfig({
-  plugins: [remixDevTools(), remix()],
+  plugins: [reactRouterDevTools(), reactRouter()],
})
```


And that's it! You should be good to go. If you have any issues, please reach out to us.
