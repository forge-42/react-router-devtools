This documentation covers everything you need to know to get started with `react-router-devtools`.

## Prerequisites

- React Router version **7.0** or higher.
- Your project needs to run on **ESM**. If you are using CommonJS, you will need to convert your project to ESM.

## Why ESM?

In order to use the full feature-set of **Vite** the project has to run on ESM. This is because Vite exposes a websocket
that **react-router-devtools** uses to communicate with the server. This websocket is **only** available in ESM projects
because it's exposed by `import.meta` which is only available in ESM.

To avoid creating user confusion and giving you a subpar experience, we have decided to only support ESM projects running on Vite.


## Why use `react-router-devtools`?

`react-router-devtools` is a comprehensive set of tools that help you develop and debug your React Router application. 

Starting from v6, it integrates [TanStack DevTools](https://tanstack.com/devtools) for enhanced debugging capabilities alongside React Router specific features.

Key features include:
- **TanStack DevTools Integration** - Enhanced state inspection and debugging capabilities powered by TanStack
- **Loader data display** - You can see the data that is being loaded by your loaders.
- **Route display** - You can see the routes that are being used by your application in list/tree format.
- **Error tracking** - You can see invalid HTML rendered on your page and where it's coming from.
- **Hydration mismatch tracking** - You can see if there are any hydration mismatches in your application, what was rendered on the client and what was rendered on the server.
- **Server logs** - You can see the logs of your server in the browser.
- **Route boundaries** - You can see the route boundaries by hovering over elements.
- **Network tracing** - Trace and analyze your loader and action execution times with detailed timing information.
