## Installation

Adding React Router Devtools to your project is easy. First install it into your project by running:

```bash
npm install react-router-devtools -D
```

This will install it as a dev dependency in your project.

## Enabling the tools (framework mode)

After you have installed the tools, you need to go to your `vite.config.ts` file which will probably look something like this:

```ts
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
})

```

All you have to do is add the plugin into the `plugins` array in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```diff
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
+ import { reactRouterDevTools } from "react-router-devtools";

export default defineConfig({
-  plugins: [reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
+  plugins: [reactRouterDevTools(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
})

```
<WarningAlert title="Warning">
Make sure your plugin is BEFORE the react router one!
</WarningAlert>


## Enabling the tools (data/declarative mode)

If you are using React Router in data/declarative mode, you can still use the devtools
by first installing @tanstack/react-devtools and then adding the devtools somewhere under
the router provider in your app.

```tsx
import { TanStackDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-devtools';
import { EmbeddedDevTools } from 'react-router-devtools';

export function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourRouterProvider>
        <YourAppComponents />
        <TanStackDevtools plugins=[{
          name: "React Router",
          render: <EmbeddedDevTools />
        }] />
      </YourRouterProvider>
      <TanStackDevtools />
    </>
  );
}
```

react-router-devtools uses @tanstack/devtools as the base for the UI, you can refer to their
[documentation](https://tanstack.com/devtools/latest/docs/overview) for more information on how to use the devtools interface.

### CloudFlare

If you're trying to spin it up on CF, try adding this to your `optimizeDeps` in your `vite.config.js` file:
```ts
optimizeDeps: {
  include: [
    // other optimized deps
  ],
},
```

**That's it!**

You should now see the React Router Devtools in your browser when you run your app.
