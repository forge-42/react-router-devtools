## 1. Quick Actions
- Edit this page → forks (if needed), opens file, PR.
- Report an issue → prefilled page context.

## 2. Fast Workflow
```bash
# one‑time
git fork + clone
pnpm install

# generate + dev
pnpm run generate:docs -- --branch main
pnpm dev
```
Create a branch:
```bash
git checkout -b docs/update-installation
```
After changes:
```bash
pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
git commit -m "docs: clarify installation"
git push -u origin docs/update-installation
```
Open PR.

## 3. What To Change
Content (preferred first contribution):
- Edit /content/**/*.mdx
- Keep frontmatter: title, summary, description
- Use number prefixes only for ordering.

Code:
- UI: app/components/*
- Utilities: app/utils/*
- Keep TypeScript strict and small focused changes.

## 4. Frontmatter Pattern
```md
---
title: Clear Title
summary: One concise line
description: Short descriptive sentence
---
```

## 5. Testing (When Code Changes)
```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
```
Add tests for new utils / non-trivial logic.
