</WarningAlert>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 22.17.0)
- **pnpm** (>= 10.13.0)
- **Git** (for version control)

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forge42/docs-template my-documentation
cd my-documentation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the `.env` file with your project-specific configuration.

### 4. Generate Documentation

Build the initial docs from the `content/` folder:

```bash
pnpm run generate:docs
```

This processes your content and outputs optimized documentation files.

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your site will now be running at **http://localhost:4280**

## Project Structure

After installation, your project will look like this:

```
my-documentation/
├── app/              # React Router application
├── content/          # Your documentation content
├── public/           # Static assets
├── resources/        # Fonts, icons, etc.
├── generated-docs/   # Generated documentation files
├── scripts/          # Build and utility scripts
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Branding**
   Update logo, colors, and header components in `app/components/`

2. **Add Your Content**
   Replace the example files in `content/` with your own documentation

3. **Prepare for Deployment**
   Configure your hosting provider (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

> 💡 The template ships with sample content so you can quickly understand the structure. You can safely delete or replace these examples once your docs are ready.
