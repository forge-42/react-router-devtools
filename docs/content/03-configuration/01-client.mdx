title: React Router Devtools Client Configuration
summary: "The client configuration lets you customize React Router Devtools behavior through the Vite plugin, including expansion level and route boundary gradient settings."
description: Configuration options for the React Router Devtools client

Before we explain all the possible options here is the client configuration Typescript type:

```ts
type RdtClientConfig = {
    expansionLevel: number;
    routeBoundaryGradient: "sea" | "hyper" | "gotham" | "gray" | "watermelon" | "ice" | "silver";
}
```

<InfoAlert>
Configuration can only be set through the Vite plugin. The settings are applied when the devtools are loaded.
</InfoAlert>

Let's go through each option and see what it does.

## Expansion Level

This option is used to set the initial expansion level of the returned JSON data in the **Active Page** tab. The default value is `1`.

If you open up the **Active Page** and look at the returned loader data with expansion level set to 1, it will look like this:

```ts
"data": {
    "property": "value"
}
```

If you set the expansion level to 0, the returned loader data will be collapsed:

```ts
"data": { ... } +
```

## Route Boundary Gradient

This option is used to set the color of the route boundary gradient. The possible values are:
- `sea`
- `hyper`
- `gotham`
- `gray`
- `watermelon`
- `ice`
- `silver`

<InfoAlert>
This changes the color of the route boundary gradient in the **Active Page** tab. When you click the "Show Route Boundary" button on a route segment in the panel, it will highlight the route's boundaries with this gradient.
</InfoAlert>

The default value is `watermelon`.

## Creating a custom configuration

To create a custom configuration you can use the following code snippet:

  ```ts
  import { defineRdtConfig } from "react-router-devtools";

  const customConfig = defineRdtConfig({
    client: {
      expansionLevel: 2,
      routeBoundaryGradient: "gotham",
    }
  });

  export default customConfig;
  ```

Then you can use this configuration in your `vite.config.js` file like this:

```ts
import customConfig from "./rdt.config";
import { reactRouterDevTools } from "react-router-devtools";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [reactRouterDevTools(customConfig)],
});
```
