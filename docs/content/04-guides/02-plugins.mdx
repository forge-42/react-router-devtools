## Plugins in Vite
Plugins work in a different way in Vite. You create a directory for plugins and just provide the path to the directory to the plugin. The plugin will automatically import all the plugins from the directory and add them to the dev tools. You only need to make sure your exports are named exports and not default exports and that they are uniquely named.

You can create a directory called plugins in your project and add your plugins there. Then you can add the following to your vite.config.js file:
```ts
import { reactRouterDevTools } from "react-router-devtools";
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    reactRouterDevTools({
      pluginDir: "./plugins"
  })],
});
```

After you're done share your plugin with the community by opening a discussion and a PR with the plugin to the repo!
