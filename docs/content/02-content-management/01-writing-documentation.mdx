## Content File Types

The template supports two types of content files:

### Markdown Files (`.md`)

Used for simple content and section indexes:

```markdown
---
title: Getting Started
---

This section covers the basics of using our product.
```

### MDX Files (`.mdx`)

Used for rich content with React components:

```mdx
---
title: Advanced Features
description: Learn about advanced functionality
summary: Advanced Guide
---

## Interactive Examples

You can embed React components directly in your content.
```

## Content Structure

### File Organization

Content is organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
content/
├── _index.mdx           # Homepage (required)
├── 01-getting-started/  # Main section
│   ├── index.md         # Section metadata (required)
│   ├── 01-installation.mdx
│   └── 02-setup.mdx
├── 02-features/         # Another section
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── 01-basic-features.mdx
│   └── 02-advanced/     # Subsection
│       ├── index.md     # Subsection metadata
│       └── 01-configuration.mdx
└── 03-api-reference.mdx # Standalone page
```

### Frontmatter

All content files require frontmatter with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"                    # Required: Page title
description: "SEO description"         # Optional: Meta description
summary: "Short description"           # Optional: Used in navigation
---
```

## Code Blocks

Standard markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
// This will be syntax highlighted
function example() {
  return "Hello World"
}
```

Diff highlighting for showing changes:

```diff
- const old = "removed code"
+ const new = "added code"
  const unchanged = "stays the same"
```

### Inline Code

Use backticks for `inline code` references.

### Links and Navigation

Standard markdown links work automatically:

```markdown
[Link to another page](../other-section/page-name)
[External link](https://example.com)
```

The template automatically generates:
- Table of contents from headings
- Previous/next page navigation
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Content Processing

### URL Generation

File paths are automatically converted to clean URLs:

- `content/01-getting-started/02-installation.mdx` → `/getting-started/installation`
- Number prefixes (`01-`, `02-`) are removed from URLs
- File extensions are stripped

### Search Integration

All content is automatically indexed for search:

- Page titles and descriptions
- Heading text
- Paragraph content
- Code block content (optional)

Content is processed by `app/components/command-k/create-search-index.ts`.

## Best Practices

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make headings clear and specific
2. **Add Descriptions**: Include frontmatter descriptions for SEO
3. **Structure with Headings**: Use proper heading hierarchy (H2 → H3 → H4)
4. **Link Between Pages**: Create connections between related content

### File Naming

1. **Use Number Prefixes**: `01-`, `02-` for ordering
2. **Descriptive Names**: `installation.mdx` not `setup.mdx`
3. **Consistent Casing**: Use kebab-case for file names

### Content Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related content in sections
2. **Appropriate Nesting**: Don't go too deep (max 2 levels recommended)
3. **Index Files**: Always include `index.md` for sections
