    Your Remix app is so performant thatâ€“even without a solid internet
    connectionâ€“navigation on your site seems to happen almost instantaneously.
    Whether rendered on the client side or server side, pages load data quickly
    and all the information you users are interested in is on the screen without
    the wait. But why?


    In this talk, we discuss the optimizations in Remix for data fetching and
    rendering apps in the browser that enhance both the user experience and
    developer experience.

    Modeling business logic with state machines has numerous benefits, from
    eliminating bugs caused by impossible states to visualizing the logic to
    communicate with non-technical shareholders to simply communicating user
    flow between technical colleagues. In this talk, I'm going to demonstrate,
    via live coding, how to combine the strengths of Remix and XState to create
    a checkout flow entirely on the backend. No. JavaScript. Required.

- title: Remix 3D Blast
  time: 12:05 PM
  type: lightning
  description: >-
    Whether you want to progressively enhance a traditional website or build an
    immersive 3D experience, Remix gives us a powerful and fun framework to
    create with WebGL and three.js. After deploying a 3D Remix experience to
    production, I've found that all the patterns that Remix provides are just as
    valuable even when we're not rendering to the DOM. In this talk, I'll show
    off some zany 3D antics to explain how Remix and react-three-fiber can work
    together to help you build fantastic experiences for your users.


    We'll focus on: getting react-three-fiber set up in a Remix app; using
    nested routes and layouts to render a scene; moving scene state to the
    server with loaders and actions; streaming dynamic 3D resources to the
    client using resource routes; and finally, transitions and optimistic UI...
    in 3D! ðŸ’¿ Rachel the Remix Disc will offer some nifty optimization tips
    along the way.


    It'll be a GL-and-web-fundamentals-fuelled blast!

  description: >-
    Nowadays, building a working web application is much more than deploying it
    to production. The impact on the way your app is delivered to your end-users
    is also important.


    Making your app experience better translates into more engagement,
    conversions, and revenue. That's why it is also vital (pun intended) to know
    how your application behaves, and that's where Web Vitals help us get a
    clear overview of how our app is doing.

  time: 12:15 PM
  type: lightning
  description: >-
    The Cache-Control header has been around since HTTP/1.1 in 1997, yet for
    many of us, it's not something we think about every day. The
    stale-while-revalidate extension was proposed as early as 2010, but was only
    widely supported in modern browsers in 2019. In this talk, I will show you
    the power of stale-while-revalidate and how you can take advantage of it in
    your Remix project to make your slow responses seem really fast!

    In this talk we are going to be talking about how to build hybrid apps that
    use a combination of frameworks like Remix and mixing them with no-code
    backends like Zapier and Airtable, so that they can be managed and modified
    by non-technical people.


    I will specifically go over how I replaced the admissions process at my
    children's preschool with a website and made them paperfree.

- title: "Full Stack Fast: Data on the Edge"
  time: 2:35 PM
  type: lightning
  description: >-
    Why force your users to settle for either loading skeletons or slow page
    renders? Remix can bring your application rendering to the edge, but what
    about your data? Why should every request have to call back to a single
    database cluster in Virginia? For the best performance and experience for
    your users, store your data on the edge, alongside the rest of your
    application.


    We'll discuss how the original colocated server and database configuration
    worked, how it evolved with Jamstack, improved with next-gen data services,
    and how today's technology supports a new architecture altogether. But
    distributed systems are notoriously hard to design for, and edge-based
    storage is no different, with the challenges of synchronicity being a
    particularly difficult problem. I'll highlight the benefits of edge-based
    storage, how it compares to the other options, and I'll showcase a truly
    global Remix application built with Cloudflare's KV, Durable Objects and R2.

    Build performant web apps with a full-stack framework, Remix. Remix focuses
    on the UI to enjoy fast & resilient UX. Experience the "Remix magic" that
    enables no fetching & pre-fetch all in parallel before users make actions.
    As Remix focuses on UI & UX, why not share the "Remix magic" with the
    business users? In this talk, we're going to see together the combination of
    the new generation of a full-stack framework, Remix & a visual editor
    integrated headless CMS (Storyblok). Are you ready to explore a whole new
    level of experience?

  time: 3:10 PM
  type: regular
  description: >-
    One of the beautiful things about Remix is how easy it is to enhance it to
    make our lives easier. In this talk, I'll show you how I built [Remix
    Forms](https://remix-forms.seasoned.cc/) and how I use it to:

    - Code only the parts of my forms that stray from our standard UI. The rest
    is magically rendered for me.

    - Never have to think again about client-side + server-side validations,
    pending indicators, and focus management (with focus on the first field with
    error even for server-side failures!)

    - Get form data, validate values, redirect or return errors with one helper.
    I focus on the mutation, not on the wiring.

    - Catch any typo or mistake right away with bulletproof typing, even for
    custom inputs.

    - Enjoy the autocomplete magic that comes along with it :)

    Remix is fantastic for building brand-new apps. But the truth is most of us
    are slogging away on crusty old ones. How can we incorporate Remix into our
    stacks without rewriting everything? And how can we effectively sell our
    teams on the benefits of adoption? In this talk we'll explore some
    strategies that will let you gradually adopt Remix, progressively enhancing
    your tech stack.

- title: "Outstanding Search Experiences with Remix and Algolia"
  time: 4:25 PM
  type: regular
  description: >-
    Outstanding search starts with two principles: immediate feedback and
    relevant results.

    Search-as-you-type experiences have become the standard since Google
    introduced Google Suggest and Google Instant on their search page in the
    2000s. Users not only love the immediate feedback of instant experiences,
    they expect it. They also expect search to be excellent at understanding
    their intent, even when they misspell or forget words.

    Services like Algolia are designed to deliver instant, as-you-type, relevant
    results right from the first keystrokes. But what happens when the user's
    network is slow? What's relevant when the user didn't express intent yet?Â In
    this talk, we'll see how you can combine Algolia's client-side search with
    the power of Remix's server runtime to create snappy and delightful yet
    reliable and resilient search experiences that serve everyone.

  description: >-
    Neighbor is a marketplace that allows you to make extra cash by storing your
    neighbors' things in your extra space. After several years of using a
    standard React frontend generated by create-react-app, we've decided to move
    to Remix. I will discuss some of the crazy things we've done at Neighbor to
    work around the limitations of a standard CRA-generated application, why we
    chose to use Remix over other alternatives, and discuss some of the gotchas
    and learning that came out of the migration. If you work at a medium to
    large business and are interested in moving to Remix, this talk is
    especially for you. I will mostly stick to big picture concepts rather than
    diving deep into the code.

  type: backup
  description: >-
    In late 2020, I ran a Lighthouse test on a simple content page on Harvie,
    our farm management platform and Symfony app, and received a performance
    score of 31/100. The JavaScript bundle, the API requests, the database
    lookups, even with minimal UI to render, had a baseline score in the
    thirties! Along with customer feedback, this helped to catalyze a renewed
    commitment to performance at Harvie. Through numerous discussions, we walked
    through each step of page load, from networking to rendering, and identified
    where we could improve. After a year of rewrites and upgrades, our remaining
    detriment to overall performance was our frontend. We had been converting
    our Symfony twig templates into React SPA components and fell into the
    common problem of creating "request waterfalls", while our user had to stare
    at a loading screen. We needed a change, and for us, that was Remix. In this
    talk, I'll walk you through our team's journey with performance and how
    Remix has become a natural progression of that.

  type: backup
  description: >-
    We will walk through a simple demonstration of a remix application using
    nested routes and parameterized routes. The use of nested routes helps me
    with component design and separation when architecting  an application.
    Parameterized routes / Dynamic Routes contain state information that can
    through the parameters that are defined on the route. This provides powerful
    flexibility when designing your app and app's components. Putting the two
    together in an simple solution to be a reference when you build something
    amazing.
